TikTok is a great way to make videos with music and record them. It's pretty self-sufficient when it comes to adding songs or sounds to a video because its music library has a wide range of audio resources.

TikTok has a simple tool called "Trim Sound" that you can find under "Sound" or "Add a Sound" that lets you change where your video starts. Before you learn how to use the trim sound feature on TikTok, you should know that you can't use it to cut up a sound to make a custom mix.

In the same way, the sound trim feature can only be used if the length of the sound is longer than the preset time length chosen when the video was shot. For example, if your camera mode is set to 30 seconds and your track is also 30 seconds or shorter, you can't "trim" the song to start at a different point.

Now that that's out of the way, let's learn how to trim sound on the TikTok app.

Part 1: How to Cut a TikTok Sound Before You Record
--------------------

You can trim a sound or piece of music on TikTok in two different ways, either before you start to record a video or after you've already done so.

1. Let's start by learning how to cut music on TikTok before we make a video.
2. Open TikTok and tap the "+" icon in the middle of the bottom of the screen.
3. Press "Add a sound" at the top to choose the song you want to add to your video.
4. Once it's been chosen, use the musical note icon with the scissors in the list on the right to start cutting it to the length you want.
5. On the next screen, you'll see a waveform for the new music. Drag the waveform to choose a part of the song.
6. When you're happy with the song, tap the red checkmark to confirm. 

Part 2: How to Cut Out a Sound After Recording on TikTok
--------------------

The other way to trim a sound on TikTok is to cut the music clip after your TikTok video has been recorded. Follow the easy steps below to trim a sound on TikTok after you've recorded or uploaded your own clips.

1. Open TikTok and tap the "+" sign to record a new video or upload one from your device's library.
2. Click the "Sounds" icon in the bottom-left corner of the screen to choose music for your video.
3. Once you open the sound library, you can choose music from TikTok's library or use a sound from your favorites.
4. When you choose the one you want, you can trim it however you want. To do this, press the scissors icon and drag the sound wave to change when the audio starts and stops.
5. When you're done, go back. From here, you can add effects, filters, stickers, and text to your video to tie it all together and make it much more interesting.

Now that you know how to cut a sound on TikTok, you should give it a try. Shoot amazing videos and add cool music and other effects to make videos that look good.
